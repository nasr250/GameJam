About the game:
- A webcam and a colored object required to play the game. They are the main way to control the player while playing.
! The game was made with the idea that the camera looks down at the player from above, if the controls are inverted or mirrored, this is why !
- The Aforge webcam library is required to run this game, you need to download it before playing.
- In order to calibrate the webcam's color recognision to make it recognise the colored object of your choice, use the options menu.
- You can set the game to fullscreen by pressing F5.
- You start playing the game by clicking on the "play" button.

Debug:
- You can cycle through the various power-ups by pressing "U" on the keyboard while playing. This was left in the game so the people who only get to see this game once can experience the verious power-ups, even if it wasn't intended that way.

Voice Recognition:
- The voice recognition requires a microphone.
- The voice recognition is a separate program that was made to compliment the main code, by allowing the player to shoot by shouting "PEW".
